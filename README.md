# OS X Dotfiles Configurations

Everyone likes to setup the working machine on your way. That's my way. Feel free to check it out :+1:
**Important**: This is *my way* to make the computer works to my needs.  Feel free to suggest something but remind to do not stay sad if I do not accept it :wink:

## What it has

In my days working I got used to some facilities and some times I need to get rid of old stuffs and reinstall every thing again. But instead of make all manually I prefer made it with ease


### Making some basic installs

Now there are some programs that I like. It can be installed with the follow script

```bash
./mac-dotfiles/setup-machine.sh
```


### Now simlink everything

With this script you will configure `Vim`, `Tmux`, `Zsh` and `Oh-my-zsh` theme, add some needed fonts to make vim looks great

```bash
./mac-dotfiles/setup-dotfiles.sh
```
